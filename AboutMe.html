<h2> Hello My name is not going to be said for reasons but I am expeiriancing my time coding which so far I have enjoyed. In my life when I was five I learn the basics of talking and know my numbers which my father tuaght of teaching me the multiplication table at first it look confuseing and the more I practiced I felt like its possible to learn them if I practiced saying them without looking at the paper four and 2 days later I fully learned them. From that day adn on my math classes were alot easier. Some things Ive done are jioning clubs getting through school and most of my spare time was voluntaring work which I hope college will count that as voluntary help. My first team was in 8th grade the gateway elementary soccer team and played mid left and right and defense all positions. I jioned my first robotics club in highschool.</h2>
