	<h3> Today I have learned how the internet works and how it travels around the world. It all starts witha request from your computer to the DNS (Domain,Name,Server). Which it looks for the websites address and after that the server accepts the request and sends the website in packages to your computer.  </h3>

	<h1>Ceasar Cipher</h1>
	<h2>Today I learned about ceasar cipher which is a way to encrypt an decrypt a message. Which is shifting the last five letters to front of the alphabet. But you can change that using a key which you and the other person your communicating too with a shift amount to make the message harder for others to encrypt. </h2>

	<h1>Circuts, Arduino</h1>
	<h2>Today we have started to make some circyts with arduino which I encountered a few problems but the solution to each one is the LED needed to be flipped. I also knew of how resistors, LEDS, and bread boards worked. The bread board's holes is connected in rows and columns, a LED is a Light Emitting Diod which is a small light for circuts. In every circut there is a voltage current and resitance. Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps, and resistance is measured ohms.</h2>

	 <h1>Robotics</h1><h2> Today we worked with robots and we got a code that works which makes the robot go backwards once it senses something in the distance. A problem that we have is were the right motor is stronger that the left wch in the beginning of the test were it drove straight. After going backwards when it detects something the motors no longer are the same strength.</h2>
